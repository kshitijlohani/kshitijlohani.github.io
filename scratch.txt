I am Kshitij Raj Lohani from Kathmandu, Nepal currently living in Cupertino, California.
By age 14, i changed 10 schools. At grade 6 i was rusticated from too much fighting, then at grade 8 i was thrown out because
i could not pay monthly tuition fee $40. That real hurt me, i used that time to set National record in memorization power.
That helped me to get full scholarship at Nobel Academy, from where i gave my SLC.
