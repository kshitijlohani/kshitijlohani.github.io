I am Kshitij Raj Lohani from Nepal.
By age 14, i changed 10 schools. At grade 6 i was rusticated for too much fighting, then at grade 8 i was thrown out of school because
i could not pay monthly tuition fee $40. That real hurt me, i used that time to set National record in memorization power which
helped me to get full scholarship at Nobel Academy, from where i gave my SLC exam. Then i joined Chelsea Academy for my A-levels.
In 2010, i recevied full ride Trustee scholarship from Northeastern University with my application essay 'i gave condom to my father'.
During my undergrad, i designed a device and sent Nepal's flag to edge of the space and played National anthem over there. I was awared
with 'National Youth Award' by Government of Nepal. However, during this time, unfortunately i had to face very difficult mental problem and it took me years to overcome it. Definitely the worst days,
of my life.
right out of college, i joined Goldman Sachs (i wanted to work in Wall Street very badly) as a software engineer in R&D engineering team (crypto oh yeah) and in Datalake team.
But then i wanted to join my dream company; Apple. And i did it. Currenty i am software engineer at Apple in iPhone team.
