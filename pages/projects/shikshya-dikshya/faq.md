**Whats the format**

> At least a month before the show date,
> a communication is started with donors to find what kind of person they would like to
> help and what kind of help. Then, we search for the people who need help (and match the
profile as requested by donors).
> Now, we forward the receivers profile to donors and get their confirmation. Once, we receive the confirmation; BOOM - we shoot video, provide help to receiver, release the video and update every detail about the process in website.
> But it does not end here, receivers are required to provide update for a year (in 3 months interval). This is to ensure, the 'help' received is used for the right purpose.
