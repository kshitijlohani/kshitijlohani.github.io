**What is Shikshya-Dikshya**

> 'Shikshya-Dikshya' is an online 100 sec show, where a deserving candidate with financial difficulty gets help from a donor to move ahead in life. Thats it.

**Why this name**

> 'Shikshya' means education and 'Dikshya' means enlightening someone.
> Also, this project is a tribute to someone who came to my life when i was in the worst phase of my life. That person uplifted my life and made me who i am today. I owe my happiness and success to that person. Thank you.

**Whats the format**

> At least a month before the show date,
> a communication is started with donors to find what kind of person they would like to
> help and what kind of help. Then, we search for the people who need help (and match the
profile as requested by donors).
> Now, we forward the receivers profile to donors and get their confirmation. Once, we receive the confirmation; BOOM - we shoot video, provide help to receiver, release the video and update every detail about the process in website.
> But it does not end here, receivers are required to provide update for a year (in 3 months interval). This is to ensure, the 'help' received is used for the right purpose.

**How to i get Donors**

> I just talk to people i know.

**How to i find candidate**

> i post in social media about what kind of 'candidate' donors have requested for.
> and people can let me know about candidate via [candidate nomination form](/shikshya-dikshya/know-someone-in-need/)
