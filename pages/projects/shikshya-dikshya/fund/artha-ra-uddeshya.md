The goal of my life is to make it meaningful, which I believe, can be done by helping others and by spreading happiness. Hence, I decided to create a fund which would signify “Meaning & Goal” translated as “Artha Ra Uddeshya” in Nepali. “Artha” also means “money”. If a little bit of my financial contribution can facilitate someone to achieve their goal, that would give a lot of meaning to my life. I hope this fund sustains and helps more people in coming days
