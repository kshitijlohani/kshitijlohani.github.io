> What is it?

On April 30, 2014 I carried out my long dream of sending Nepal's Flag & playing Nepal's National Anthem on the 'Edge of the Space.'
Using the weather ballon-high altitude concept i was able to send the flag of Nepal in the edge of the space/ very high altitude (80,000 ft above earth surface). When it reached around 70,000 ft, national anthem of Nepal was played through the speaker inside a payload box.
